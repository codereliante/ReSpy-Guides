### Getting Started
The easiest way to setup ReSpy is with the `/license` command.<br/>
After using the command, you'll see a parameter called 'activation-code'<br/>
To get the code for that paramter, visit the ReSpy server and open the ticket you used to purchased a license.</br>
Upon purchase, they'll send you a 16 Character code after payment was made. <br/>
Copy the code the Staff Member gives you, and paste it as the parameter in the bot.</br>

# BOOM YOUR DONE!
